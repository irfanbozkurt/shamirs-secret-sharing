# Shamir's Secret Sharing

We allow users to generate Leo code that splits a given secret into $n$ shares, from which $k$ of them is sufficient recover the original secret when all put back together.

- $k$ is the number of evaluations required to reconstruct the secret. Maximum value it can take is 32 (bounded by Leo's array size).
- $n$ is the number of evaluations you want. Again, $k$ of them will suffice for recovery.

## Considerations

1. Leo does not support variable-sized arrays. To achieve fine-grained functionality, we present TypeScript code that generates SSS as Leo code for some given $(k, n)$ parameters.
2. We support secret splitting up to 32 pieces $k \leq 32$, but you can get as many evaluations (of your secret polynomial) as you want, up to 1024 points. Out of these, $k$ of them will suffice for recovery.

## How to Use

First you must generate the contract for $(k, n)$ parameters of your choice. Then, you can either use `leo run` or our wrappers within `package.json` to split a share, or recover a secret from evaluations. We describe each step within this section.

### Generating the Aleo contract

```sh
# bun gen <n> <k>
bun gen 10 3
```

This will output a `outputs/main.leo` that contains all required Leo code to split a given secret and to recover it back, following given parameters. This will also prepare a `inputs/shamir.in` file in which user will put the inputs to the `recover` function (more on this later).

### Splitting the secret

After the codegen phase, run the following command from the root directory to split the secret.

> [!WARNING]  
> Your secret needs to be a [field element](https://developer.aleo.org/advanced/the_aleo_curves/edwards_bls12/).

```sh
# bun split <secret>
bun split 96024field

# or with leo
leo run split 96024field
```

### Recovering the secret

Grab $k$ of the field elements outputted in step-2, and place them into `/inputs/shamir.in` file. For $k=3$, the file should already look as follows:

```js
[recover]
evals: [[field; 2]; 3] = [

];
```

You basically need to place any 3 elements outputted by step-2 here. A valid input would look as follows:

```js
[recover]
evals: [[field; 2]; 3] = [
  [
    6field,
    8085709056458833402027478012051955642975336737559694498490266579832655590565field

  ]
];
```

After placing this input, you can call the recover algorithm as follows:

```sh
bun recover

# or with leo
leo run recover
```

And you have the secret back.

## Testing

We have written a small test that runs several cases of $(k, n)$ where a random secret is splitted and then recovered again. To run them:

```sh
bun run test
```

Note that this is not `bun test`, but instead calls the `test` script within `package.json` which has some parameters passed into Bun.
